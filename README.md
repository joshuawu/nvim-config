# My Nvim Config

# Installation

1. Make sure that `~/.config/nvim` either does not exist or is empty.
2. Clone this repository there:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/joshuawu/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
```

# Setup

1. Launch `nvim`. `lazy.nvim` will automatically install plugins.
2. Run `:Mason` and install any needed external tools such as:
  - `json-lsp`
  - `lua-language-server`
  - `prettierd`
  - `pyright`
  - `rust-analyzer`
  - `stylua`
3. Install `libgit2` with your package manager.
4. Install a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) and use it in your terminal.
5. (Optional) Add a Python provider.
```sh
mkdir ~/.config/nvim/python
python -m venv ~/.config/nvim/python/venv
source ~/.config/nvim/python/venv/bin/activate # pick the script for your shell
pip install pynvim
deactivate
```
6. (Optional) Add a Node provider.
```sh
npm install -g neovim
```
7. Run `:checkhealth` to see if there are any issues.

# Usage

## User Keymaps
- `<Leader>` is mapped to `<Space>` in `init.lua`.
- `<M-` is the Meta or Alt modifier key.
  - On OSX, the Option key can be used. This config will automatically enable using Option as Meta until you exit `nvim`.
    - If it doesn't work, enable DECSET 1036 support for your terminal.
      - In iTerm2, this can be enabled under `Settings > Advanced`. (Beta builds of iTerm2 should have this already enabled.)
        - Make sure "Apps can change this" is checked under your profile's `Keys > General` settings.
    - If your terminal doesn't support DECSET 1036, enable using Option as Meta globally in your terminal settings.
